    The Centro+ incubator builds on the work of the ESA Space Solutions Portugal programme, which delivered ESA-backed
    incubation at IPN between 2014 and 2025. This legacy page preserves the verified milestones, recorded successes, and alumni
    testimonials from that era so new teams can understand the continuity of support.

      The previous programme emphasised rapid prototyping, investor readiness, and operational testing in both orbit and
      terrestrial applications. Highlights we will preserve include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Twice-yearly cohorts that received ESA grants alongside Portuguese matching funding.</li>
      <li>Close coordination with IPN labs to mature sensor, robotics, and lunar communications experiments.</li>
      <li>Structured mentorship from ESA technical officers plus business leads in Coimbra's innovation ecosystem.</li>
    </ul>
